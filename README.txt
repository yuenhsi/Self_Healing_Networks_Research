This project involves developing self-healing networks for the home networking space; networks that detect and mitigate existing or potential pathologies with minimal to no human intervention. 
The proposal that got our Computer Science and Classics department the funding is within the repository. This provides an elaborate description of the project. 

Upon reviewing my final writeup, I have attached it to my repository as well. However, for academic and research purposes, code I have written for the department over this research period can not be publicized.
Instead, I provided the final writeup I have done with my team, as well as an individual presentation I gave to summarize our findings.
